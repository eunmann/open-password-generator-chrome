# Open Password Generator - Chrome Extension

## Overview
The Open Password Generator is an open-source extension designed specifically for the [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser. It addresses the absence of a built-in password generation feature in Brave by enabling users to easily create strong, secure passwords. This open-source nature ensures full transparency in the extension's functionality and security. The generated passwords are 16 characters long, including a balanced mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features
- **Easy Access**: Generate a password by right-clicking on any text input field.
- **Strong Security**: Creates passwords with at least 2 uppercase characters, 2 lowercase characters, 2 numbers, and 2 special characters.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works smoothly with web forms, triggering necessary input events for compatibility with most websites.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open Brave and navigate to `brave://extensions/`.
3. Enable 'Developer mode'.
4. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select the extension directory.

## Usage
Right-click on any text input field where you need a password, and select "Generate Password" from the context menu. A secure password will be automatically generated and filled into the input field. Note that Brave includes a Password Manager already, so it will prompt to save the password.
