# Open Password Generator - Chrome Extension

## Overview
This extension for the [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser provides a simple yet powerful feature: the ability to generate strong, secure passwords right from the context menu. It's especially designed for Brave users, as the browser lacks this built-in functionality. The extension generates a 16-character password containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features
- **Easy Access**: Generate a password by right-clicking on any text input field.
- **Strong Security**: Creates passwords with at least 2 uppercase characters, 2 lowercase characters, 2 numbers, and 2 special characters.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works smoothly with web forms, triggering necessary input events for compatibility with most websites.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open Brave and navigate to `brave://extensions/`.
3. Enable 'Developer mode'.
4. Click on 'Load unpacked' and select the extension directory.

## Usage
Right-click on any text input field where you need a password, and select "Generate Password" from the context menu. A secure password will be automatically generated and filled into the input field. Note that Brave includes a Password Manager already, so it will prompt to save the password.
